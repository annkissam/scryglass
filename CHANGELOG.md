## [Unreleased]

## Added
- Can now press `t`/`T` to create a new tab (or restart current tab) using the current/selected object(s) as the seed object.
- Can now press `c` to enter custom eval/method text to call on the current/selected object(s), producing a navigable sub-row(s) with the returned object(s).
to give a console instance variable name to current objects without leaving scry session.

## [2.0.2] - 2020-01-14

## Added

## Changed

- Added a default character limit to the method_showcase_for lens to speed it up (Some AR objects have over 1000 methods).

## Fixed

## [2.0.1] - 2020-01-13

## Changed

- The named-an-object message now stays for 3 seconds instead of 2.

## Fixed

## [2.0.0] - 2021-01-13

## Added

- Turned on ANSI formatted/colored support with AnsiSliceStringRefinement.
- Added 'AmazingPrint' lens (colored) and gem.
- Added color formatting to (beta) method_showcase_for.
- Added "Smart Open" command 'o', which attempts to create sub-rows of the (next) most helpful type.
- README and help screen now point out that holding SHIFT will increase up/down step distance.
- Bottom and right edges of screen now indicate, with dots, when there is more beyond the view's edge.
- Added the VIM home row keybindings `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as optional arrow keys.
- Now if the scry session hits an error, it will first ensure the error and console prompt appear below the present screen.
- Can now press `=` to give a console instance variable name to current objects without leaving scry session.
- Added popup messages for when the user attempts to create sub-rows for the current row and no sub-items are found.
- Added tab functionality to manage multiple scry session tabs for easy reference and comparison.
- Scryglass version now shows up in top right corner of the tree view when the header has no values to track.
- Improved and enabled 'Method Showcase' lens by default.
- Added `[<]`/`[>]` key reminders to Lens View.

## Changed

- Changed user_signal timeout period from 0.1sec to 0.3sec to reduce number of coincidentally dropped inputs.
- Changed AnsiSliceStringRefinement syntax even closer to 'string'[args] (supporting [i, l] syntax).
- Changed the keys for switching subject type and lens from `L`/`l` to `<`/`>` (To make room for vim h/j/k/l keybindings)
- Expanded list of "Patient Actions" which won't beep even if that procedure (sometimes user input) took longer than 4 seconds.
- Improved popup messages QOL (they now stack properly and don't make the user wait for them to disappear).
- Removed `scry_resume` command; bare `scry` now always resumes last session even if the current console receiver isn't `main`.
- Made help screen key text blue.

## Fixed

- Some more fixes to support (BETA) method_showcase_for:
  - Added method_source gem.
  - Now requiring lens_helper.
  - Changed method to be callable externally
- Extra view margin no longer producible at far end of ANSI strings
- Escape true newlines returned by objects with unexpected `.inspect` results, which otherwise messes up the display.
- Cursor indicators ( `(`/`@`/`Â·` ) can no longer stall or error on exceptional objects; they now show up as `X` if they error or take too long (0.05s).
- When quitting from the help screen, cursor and prompt are now set all the way at the bottom of the display, rather than where the content ends on the current *non-help* panel.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-21

## Added

- Added ability to distinguish genuine escape key presses, and added escape key functionality.
- Added ability (AnsiSliceStringRefinement) to slice strings while effectively maintaining their ANSI formatting, as our eyes would expect.
- Added some dynamic header items to Tree View that track the following:
  - Multiple targets count and message
  - Last search text (what will be searched again by hitting 'n')
  - Number-to-move, if digits are typed
  - ('?' controls reminder now only displays when header is otherwise empty)

## Changed

- Now inputs check and screen redraws every 0.1 seconds even without user keypresses.
- (ArrayFitToRefinement now allows non-plural array counts)

## Removed

- Temporarily removed record/playback functionality
- Removed all dependency on activesupport

## Fixed

- Fixed issue where shrinking the console screen size enough would create a visual glitch until one of the boundary-resizing commands was received.
